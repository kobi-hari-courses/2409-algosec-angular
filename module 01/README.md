## Understanding the web
- We talked about the `web` and its protocols
    - The `IP` protocol which allows any 2 computers to connect and communicate
    - The `TCP` and `UDP` protocol which handle the data transfer. Where `TCP` sacrifices speed for reliability while `UDP` is unraliable and used mostly for streaming and scenarios where occasional loss of data is not critical
    - The `HTTP` protocol which is used for transfer of `HTML` documents, and other browser related material.
- About the evolution of the web since 1995
    - We talked about how the web started as a huge distributed storage of documents.
    - It gradually transfered into a collection of scripts and services
    - The web evolved into web sites that provide applications rather than documents. Applications are interactive, and every page that is sent to the client provides a momentary state of the application.
- About AJAX, SPA
    - `AJAX` - Asynchronous Javascript And Xml - is a paradigm were a web page is not replaced as a response to user interaction, but rather changes using `JS`. The code sends the request (instead of the browser) and then makes changes to the `DOM` according to the received response, rather than replacing the entire page.
    - In `AJAX` the server provides data and login, instead of full `HTML` pages that repsent the session and state of the application.
    - `SPA` - Single Page Application - is an application that is pure `AJAX`. In SPA, the server does not provide any html and the page is never replaced. All the session logic is done by the client
- About Clientside technologies
- About browsers, JS engines and HTML Presenters

## Getting Started with Web Development
- Creating our work environment
    - The VSCode editor
- Creating basic web applications
- Using VS Code for development
    - HTML Features
    - CSS Features
    - Javascript Features
- Using Chrome and Firefox for Debugging

## Deep Dive into HTML 5
- Basic "Document" Tags: `h1`, `ul, li`, `p`
- Textual inline tags: `strong`, `em`
- Additional special tags: `img`, `a`
- Multi purpose tags: `div`, `span`
- Semantic tags: `header`, `nav`, `footer`, `section`
- Table tags: `table`, `thead`, `tbody`, `tr`, `th`, `td` and more
- Form Tags: `form`, `input`, `button`, `textarea`, `select`
